To run the project, you must be on your device, you must perform the following steps:
1. Setting up a local database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Creating an empty database with the same name as in your Laravel `.env` file.
3. Running `php artisan migrate` to create the necessary database tables.

I hope you like the project.
